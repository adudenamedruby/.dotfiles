# Dotfiles and Development Environment Setup Stuff

My dotfiles and my setup preferences.

# Why a repo?

Create your own dotfiles repo, clone it down on multiple computers, and symlink up your .vimrc, etc. to keep environments syncronized ðŸ‘Œ

# Why share?
Sharing is caring; We learn from each other ðŸŒ·
