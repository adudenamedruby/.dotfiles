# Dotfiles and Development Environment Setup Stuff

My dotfiles and my setup preferences. All nice and neat.

# Why a repo?

Create a dotfiles repo, clone it down on multiple computers, and symlink respective files files, etc. to keep environments syncronized ðŸ‘Œ

# Why share?
Sharing is caring; We learn from each other ðŸŒ·
