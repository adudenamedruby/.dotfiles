# What dis?

Here you'll find my dotfiles, my setup/keybinding preferences, and a fun script for bootstrapping your whole system from fresh. All nice and neat.

It's a work in progress, however, and is likely to change frequently.

**Important:** if for some reason you see fit to try some of these things out, please fork the repo and remove things you don't want or need before using them. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what a thing does - a lot of this stuff is idiosyncratic to my workflow. Don't blame me if something goes wrong, or behaves how you don't like it. You have been warned.

# Installation

### First things first
- Take a moment and appreciate what an unadulterated, fresh mac looks like. Yeah, it's pretty neat. Let's get to the nitty-gritty.
- Sign in to Apple accounts; set System Preferences.
- Download and install the important stuff:
    - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)
    - [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) - set up hotkey shortcut Cmd-Ctrl-T
    - [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
- Download apps you want from App Store
    - Xcode
      - Once installed, open to install tools!
    - 1Password (also get safari/crome extension)

### Let's get phys... no. Let's get automated!
- In iTerm `git clone https://github.com/rouxbuciu/.dotfiles.git` in the home directory
- Then `cd .dotfiles` & `sh bootstrap.exclude.sh` This'll take a while.
- Once finished running, quit terminal and reboot computer for a good time!

### XVim - why settle for less!?
- Because of the certificate, these steps should be done manually.
- Rename standard xcode to Xcode-Distribution (if you need a distribution Xcode)
- Download another version of Xcode [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)
- Sign your own [code signing certificate](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2/blob/master/SIGNING_Xcode.md)
- Install [XVim2](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2)

### Spacemacs
- Spacemacs install instructions: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs (Install dev branch (if stable))

### Almost done!
- Run `brew doctor` to see any issues and fix them as needed
- Xcode themes from [here](https://github.com/hdoria/xcode-themes) and [here](http://www.codethemes.net/themes/popular/all) should go in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` (FontAndColoThemes may not exist.)
- [iTerm2 Themes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
- One last restart!

# Why a dotfiles repo?

Inspired by various members of Github, the dotfile repo is a great way to keep all your preferences the same across all dev environments! Tasty!

Furthermore.... it helps get a system going faster from fresh install to ready for development.
