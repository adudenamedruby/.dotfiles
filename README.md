# What dis?

Here you'll find my dotfiles, my setup/keybinding preferences, and a fun script for the whole thing. All nice and neat. It's a work in progress, mostly.

**Important:** if for some reason you see fit to try some of these things out, please fork the repo and remove things you don't want or need before using them. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what a thing does. Don't blame me if something goes wrong. Or do, really. But I won't feel sorry. :P

# Installation

    - 1Password (also get safari/crome extension)
    - Magnet (and set hotkeys)

    - Spotify

### Let's get Phys... no. Let's get automated!
- In iTerm `git clone https://github.com/rouxbuciu/.dotfiles.git` in the home directory
- Then `cd .dotfiles` & `bootstrap.exclude.sh` & grab some hangtime because this'll take a while.
- Once this has run, quit terminal and reboot computer for a good time!

### XVim - why settle for less!?
- Rename standard xcode to Xcode-Distribution (if you need a distribution Xcode)
- Download another version of Xcode [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)

    - Install [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) `curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`
    - open vim and run `:PlugInstall` to install plugins

# Why a dotfiles repo?

Inspired by [mathiasbyens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and others, the dotfile repo is a great way to keep all your preferences the same across all dev environments! Tasty! furthermore.... it helps get a system going faster! Finally, and most importantly, symlinked files are <3.
