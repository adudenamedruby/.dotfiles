# What dis?

Here you'll find my dotfiles and my setup preferences. All nice and neat. It's a work in progress, mostly.

**Important:** if for some reason you see fit to try some of these things out, please fork the repo and remove things you don't want or need before using them. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.

# Why a repo?

Inspired by [mathiasbyens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), the dotfile repo is a great way to keep all your preferences the same across all dev environments! Tasty!
