# adudenamedruby's dotfiles

## Why a dotfiles repo?

Inspired by various members of Github, the dotfile repo is a great way to keep all your preferences the same across all dev environments! Tasty!

Mine is, like all others, a constant work in progress, however, and is likely to change frequently.

**Important:** if for some reason you see fit to try some of these things out, please fork the repo and remove things you don't want or need before using them. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what a thing does - a lot of this stuff is idiosyncratic to my workflow. Don't blame me if something goes wrong, or behaves how you don't like it. You have been warned.
